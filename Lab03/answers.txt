Question (Lab02): 

- If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category, 
does JAVA allow you to do this? 

Answer:
- To prevent it being unable to tell which constructor method from which, Java does not allow the case. 

Specifically, a constructor method to build a DVD by title requires a single "String" type parameter, which
happens to be the same for a constructor method building a DVD by category. Accepting both cases would lead
to a "confusion" where Java does not know which method to use, and therefore it is not allowed.


Question (Lab03):

- Is JAVA a Pass by Value or a Pass by Reference programming language?

Answer:
- Java is a pass by reference language. When working with variables of primitive type, the values being passed is the variables' values. On the other hand, objects will pass their reference as the value, hence the example given in the lab03.
